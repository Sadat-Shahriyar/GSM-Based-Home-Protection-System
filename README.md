# GSM-Based-Home-Protection-System
Developed this project as a part of our CSE316 sessional course. We used ATmega32 as the main computing hardware. We also used MQ5 gas sensor, PIR sensor,
Flame sensor, Temperature sensor and SIM900A GSM module to make an alert system that will continuously monitor our home for viable dangers and notify us
whenever the system detects some irregularity.

Our project is described in the following video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jl9_cYCFvbXSfy-LCwBP9sUY9GWfhg1/view?usp=sharing
